  <p> This poem came from a magazine I chose from a stack of editions offered to me by a women in the Center for Translation Studies last week. The office is housed in the corner of a curved hallway on the quiet top most floor of Jonssen (twice I confused it for Green Hall on the sky bridge), and the woman had been dictating for an old German professor I spent 60 minutes with once five years ago. I doubt he recognized me, but his blue eyes were uncannily discerning. I think anyone over 85 is like that though. Are the eyes where wisdom is housed? Or maybe a bullshit detector. Anyway, he made me nervous, so I quickly selected this edition (alongside two others) because I liked the cover of a woman with chainmail hair colored in yellow and backed by blue.

    On a whim, I flipped through it this morning and stopped on page 116, caught by a word, reeled left to right, line by line, top down, recognizing the commonality in suburban life everywhere (even 17 years ago which I guess is by design), but then the image of the words became more specific and I was astonished because it described my morning exactly. The clicking, the workmen next-door, the tile, the language. Okay fine so it wasn't exactly exact. It was three men not two, stone slabs not tile, and I didn't understand what they were saying. Approximately exact but close enough. Close enough that it felt almost magical to have read this poem when I did. I want to use a faux posh word like serendipity, but I think what I really felt was the sense that I belong to the world and the world belongs to me.</p>
